Given a string str and another string patt. Find the minimum index of the character in str that is also present in patt.


Example 1:

Input:
str = geeksforgeeks
patt = set
Output: 1
Explanation: e is the character which is
present in given str "geeksforgeeks"
and is also presen in patt "set". Minimum
index of e is 1. 
Example 2:

Input:
str = adcffaet
patt = onkl
Output: -1
Explanation: There are none of the
characters which is common in patt
and str.

Your Task:
You only need to complete the function minIndexChar() that returns the index of answer in str or returns -1 in case no character of patt is present in str.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Number of distinct characters).


Constraints:
1 ≤ |str|,|patt| ≤ 105 
'a' <= stri, patti <= 'z'
solution:
class Solution
{
  public:
    //Function to find the minimum indexed character.
    int minIndexChar(string str, string patt)
    {
        int n=str.size();
    set<char>s;
    for(int i=0;i<patt.size();i++)
    {
        s.insert(patt[i]);
    }
    int q=-1;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(s.find(str[i])!=s.end())
        {
            q=i;
            break;
        }
        
    }
   return q;
    
    

}

    
};
