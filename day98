Problem
Chef appeared for a placement test.

There is a problem worth 
�
X points. Chef finds out that the problem has exactly 
10
10 test cases. It is known that each test case is worth the same number of points.

Chef passes 
�
N test cases among them. Determine the score Chef will get.

NOTE: See sample explanation for more clarity.

Input Format
First line will contain 
�
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers 
�
X and 
�
N, the total points for the problem and the number of test cases which pass for Chef's solution.
Output Format
For each test case, output the points scored by Chef.
