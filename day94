Vasya likes the number 
239
239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 
2
2, 
3
3 or 
9
9.

Vasya wants to watch the numbers between 
�
L and 
�
R (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
�
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
�
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
�
L and 
�
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pretty numbers between 
�
L and 
�
R.
