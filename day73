Explanation:
Test Case 
1
1: Top 
10
10 participants receive rupees 
1000
1000 and next 
90
90 participants receive rupees 
100
100 each. So, total prize money 
=
10
⋅
1000
+
90
⋅
100
=
19000
=10⋅1000+90⋅100=19000.

Test Case 
2
2: Top 
10
10 participants receive rupees 
1000
1000 and next 
90
90 participants receive rupees 
1000
1000 each. So, total prize money 
=
10
⋅
1000
+
90
⋅
1000
=
100000
=10⋅1000+90⋅1000=100000.

Test Case 
3
3: Top 
10
10 participants receive rupees 
80
80 and next 
90
90 participants receive rupee 
1
1 each. So, total prize money 
=
10
⋅
80
+
90
⋅
1
=
890
=10⋅80+90⋅1=890.

Test Case 
4
4: Top 
10
10 participants receive rupees 
400
400 and next 
90
90 participants receive rupees 
30
30 each. So, total prize money 
=
10
⋅
400
+
90
⋅
30
=
6700
=10⋅400+90⋅30=6700.
